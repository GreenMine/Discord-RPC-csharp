### 3 - Obtain a Client ID

Now you will need a Client ID. To obtain it just go to [the Discord developper applications panel](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me) and click "**New App**".
Give it a nice App name, click the "**Create app**" button, then the "**Enable Rich Presence**" button.

### 4 - Mess with it

Copy the **Client ID** at the top of the page and paste it in the **Client ID** field in the app.
Click "**Initialize**" then "**Update**" and you should see this below your username and in your Discord profile:
